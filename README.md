# Landon-Viator-Audio-Developer-Resume
 
## Introduction

**Brief:** As a specialized software developer in audio application development, I focus on crafting audio plugins compatible with digital audio workstations for both 64-bit Mac (AU & VST3) and Windows (VST3) systems. In addition to plugins, I am skilled in developing desktop applications for Mac and Windows platforms. 

**Philosophy:** The heart of my work is built from a profound dedication to music, grown through years of academic study, earning degrees at the bachelor's, master's, and PhD levels in music. My objective is to support and enhance the creative journey of those making music, whether through education, personal production, or the development of software applications. I strive to create tools that add genuine value, steering clear of practices that prioritize profit over purpose, such as directly replicating existing successful plugins, rushing minimalistic applications to market at inflated prices, or misleadingly marketing a product as more substantial than it is.

**Why Me:** My educational foundation in music performance and theory has honed my musical ear, making it exceptionally adept at discerning the quality of audio in algorithms. Additionally, my studies in music theory and composition have cultivated a highly creative mindset, ideal for innovative problem-solving and product development.

## Previous Projects and Work

**Bedroom Comp by Viator DSP**

**Link:** [Bedroom Comp](https://github.com/landonviator/viator-bedroom-comp) <br>
**Overview:** A compressor and limiter for Mac and PC. <br> 
**Challenges:** I aimed to create a unique and impactful knee parameter for Bedroom Comp. I experimented with various trigonometric functions until I achieved a distinctive and appealing knee curve..

**Space by Cymatics**

**Link:** https://cymatics.fm/products/space <br>
**Overview:** A reverb for Mac and PC. <br> 
**Challenges:** Notable challenges were creating a DSP framework for this plugin and future Cymatics plugins.

**Rust by Viator DSP**

**Link:** [Rust](https://github.com/landonviator/viator-rust) <br>
**Overview:** A lofi tape noise and distortion plugin for Mac and PC. <br> 
**Challenges:** Notable challenges to develop a noise generator plugin inspired by the subtle crackle and dust of vinyl. Unlike conventional vinyl noise plugins that rely on pre-recorded audio or live capture methods, I aimed to synthesize these sounds purely through DSP techniques.


**Behringer Synth Suite Bundle**

**Overview:** A Suite of software synth versions of hardware Behringer synths for Mac and PC. <br> 
**Challenges:** Notable challenges were creating a plugin framework to reduce development time of the 20+ plugins and unify features/operation. Required A year of work with DSP engineers, graphic designers, and my development team of 5.

**ADPTR Audio**

**Overview:** Research and development to engineer innovative distortion algorithms. <br>
**Challenges:** Notable challenges were researching all available literature on audio distortion effects, modeling other plugin responses in Matlab, and crafting algorithms to achieve similar shape and quality.

**The Audio Programmer**

**Overview:** A plugin aimed at EDM producers that combines a common, multi-plugin workflow into one unified plugin. <br>
**Challenges:** Notable challenges were working on a team that did not conduct meetings and researching methods to implement linear phase response filters.

**Viator DSP YouTune Channel**

Link: https://www.youtube.com/@drbruisin <br>
**Overview:** A YouTube channel dedicated to educate viewers on c++, JUCE, and audio app development. <br> 
**Challenges:** Notable challenges were crafting engaging video topics, staying up to date on JUCE changes, and managing negative and positive responses.


**PhD Dissertation on Chaotic DSP Implementation**[]

**Link:** [Dissertation](https://repository.lsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=6232&context=gradschool_dissertations) <br>
**Overview:** A dissertation on the culmination of my work focused in using chaotic and dynamical systems in creating unique audio effects. <br>
**Challenges:** Notable challenges were compiling all of my work into a single, unified document while also composing music as part of it.
