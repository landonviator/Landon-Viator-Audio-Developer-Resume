# Landon-Viator-Audio-Developer-Resume
 
## Introduction

**Brief:** As a specialized software developer in audio application development, I focus on crafting audio plugins compatible with digital audio workstations for both 64-bit Mac (AU & VST3) and Windows (VST3) systems. In addition to plugins, I am skilled in developing desktop applications for Mac and Windows platforms. 

**Philosophy:** The heart of my work is built from a profound dedication to music, grown through years of academic study, earning degrees at the bachelor's, master's, and PhD levels in music. My objective is to support and enhance the creative journey of those making music, whether through education, personal production, or the development of software applications. I strive to create tools that add genuine value, steering clear of practices that prioritize profit over purpose, such as directly replicating existing successful plugins, rushing minimalistic applications to market at inflated prices, or misleadingly marketing a product as more substantial than it is.

**Why Me:** My educational foundation in music performance and theory has honed my musical ear, making it exceptionally adept at discerning the quality of audio in algorithms. Additionally, my studies in music theory and composition have cultivated a highly creative mindset, ideal for innovative problem-solving and product development.
